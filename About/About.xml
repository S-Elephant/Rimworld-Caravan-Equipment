	<description>Adds new lightweight stuff for caravans aimed at players using the Setup Camp mod.
	
I had some cases where my bigger caravans got hit by stuff like the plague and I was unable to rescue my colonists due to lack of decent beds and such. Now I can equip my caravans properly. I made this mod for myself but oh well why not release it for everybody right?
